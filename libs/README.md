# Library

Many of scripts listed here actually some old projects which I never research first for "did this ever exists?". I just wanna invent something and ... reinvent the wheel again with 4~42% quality. It is too bad if I just throw off all my creations, I give a lot of eefort for them and that time. Just imaging a 12-16 years boy making script which professional has been done.

So... I just wanna appreciate my little me for the journey he has been made these far. For you, please research first. Do not reinvent the wheel. I also give you some alternative what my scripts listed here exist as a stable modules.

## Utilities

I made many utilities scripts to help myself. But at that moment I never search any utilities libraries, which is Lodash should really help me at that time. So for you, please reference to this.

- Lodash
- MomentJS
- MathJS
- OpenCV JS

## App

**PitungJS**, it is an exploit (or Trojan my little me called it). It is not really usefull, so you could use BeEF instead.

- BeEF (The Browser Exploitation Framework)
- Metasploit

**Determinan** is a matrix calculator. You could use this instead:
- https://matrixcalc.org/
- https://www.desmos.com/
- https://www.geogebra.org/

**HTML Editor**, at first, I want to build it looks like Codepen and the editor could be disattached to a new window. But, I failed. So use this instead:
- **Instant Code Editor:** Codepen, JSFiddle, jsBin
- **Runtime & Compiler:** Repl.it, Codesandbox, Stackblitz, Jupyter Notebook
- **Cloud IDE:** VSCode Dev, Github Dev, Codespace, Gitpod, Coder
